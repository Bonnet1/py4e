## Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology ##

**Object** is a bit of self-contained Code and Data

**Class** - a template (e.g. dog)
**Method or Message** - a defined capability of a class (something the object can do, e.g. bark())
**Field or Attribute** - a bit of data in a class
**Object or Instance** - a particular instance of a class (real thing -- a dog))

Special blocks - constructor (setup initial values) and destructor (rarely used)

**Object Inheritance** (also called subclass)
We can reuse an existing class and inherit all the capabilities of an existing class and add on our own little bit to make a new class
