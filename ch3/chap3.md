# Conditional Statements

**Indentation** - make sure to keep conditional code together, Python should read indentations as spaces rather than tabs to avoid errors

**One-Way vs. Two-Way Decisions** - use if/while for one-way, else for two-way

**Multi-Way** - run multiple elif statements to generate multiple puzzles

**Try and Except** - can eliminate or catch traceback and continue running through the code, but only but minimal amount of info in try and except block
